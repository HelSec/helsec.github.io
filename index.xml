FIRST OPTION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE PARTICIPANTS TO EARLIER WORKSHOP. SLOTS WILL BE OPENED IN CASE THERE ARE CANCELATIONS.**&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction to Ghidra and Firmware Reverse Engineering.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an entry level workshop that serves as an introduction to ghidra in the context of hardware firmware reverse engineering. We will be using a multi timezone clock as the case study. The clock uses a MC-48 series microcontroller from the seventies that is quite simple and easier to understand than modern processors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading the first 40 pages of [&lt;a href="https://devsaurus.github.io/mcs-48/mcs-48.pdf%5D(https://devsaurus.github.io/mcs-48/mcs-48.pdf">https://devsaurus.github.io/mcs-48/mcs-48.pdf](https://devsaurus.github.io/mcs-48/mcs-48.pdf&lt;/a>) or the start of the MCS-48 users manual should give enough starting information to understand the system. The MCS-48 Users manual in particular has a really good section about how a (simple) processor works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please install ghidra ([&lt;a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/%5D(https://ghidra-sre.org/">https://ghidra-sre.org/](https://ghidra-sre.org/&lt;/a>)) beforehand and make sure it runs on your system.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For OSX users it is recommended to use &amp;lsquo;brew&amp;rsquo; for installing and also install &amp;lsquo;gradle&amp;rsquo; and then in console go to homebrew_base/Caskroom/ghidra//ghidra-/Ghidra/&amp;rsquo; and execute &amp;lsquo;gradle buildNatives&amp;rsquo; to get locally signed versions of the native extensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The outline of the workshop will be:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A short presentation on the hardware&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guided setup of the ghidra project&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guided tour of the main ghidra features&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Reverse engineering the firmware in small groups&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Few hints will be provided as the workshop progresses&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>At the end we will go through the program and what it does&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The event will be hosted at Elisa premises in Pasila.&lt;br>
Participants will need to provide their full name for Elisa&amp;rsquo;s visitor registration.&lt;/p>
