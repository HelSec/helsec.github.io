HelSec Ry is a cybersecurity group by the community, for the community.

HelSec was originally founded in 2018 so that security professionals and enthusiasts in the Helsinki region could meet and network with other like-minded people. The very first meetup took place in 2019. During the pandemic (COVID-19), HelSec currently organizes virtually held meetups regularly. We are active in social media; Twitter, IG, FB & LinkedIn.
