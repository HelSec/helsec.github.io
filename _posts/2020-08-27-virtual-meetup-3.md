## Speaker bio
_Nour Fateen_  is a cybersecurity specialist with over seven years of experience in the industry. Currently at Recorded Future, Nour has spent the last three years helping some of the largest businesses in the world improve their security posture using security intelligence. He has previously held positions in Cisco Systems and Goldman Sachs. Nour received a Master in Electronic Engineering & Nanotechnology from University College London.

_Silke_ works for 20 years in telco security and was honored for her security work in 2019 (Suomen Leijonan ritari). She has worked with more security specifications than coffee cups in her life and knows how to spot weak spots in them. Her sec research was presented at BlackHat, DefCon and (most important) Disobey. She recently left a big finnish mobile network vendor and joined a small weird (but extremely interesting) company in Ireland called Adaptive Mobile Security and setting new levels or remote working. There she can get hold of real-life network nation state attacks to telcos (cool), works on threat intelligence (love math & logs & protocols!) and can build and contribute to the best telco firewalls ever that protect millions of people (about time). Now at the dawn of 5G, 5G security has moved into the spotlight and always on the research front, there she goes and explores. Oh, and she officially advises EU ENISA and other governments and operators on 5G Security.

_Ilhan Gurel_ currently works for Ericsson in the CTO organization as an expert on trusted HW and SW technologies. His current role involves various security activities related to HW security, SW security, OS & Platform security and practical use of cryptography.
