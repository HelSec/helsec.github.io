## Speaker bio

_Aapo Oksman_ - Aapo is a Senior Security Specialist at Nixu Cybersecurity, where he works with application, protocol and device security with the focus on industrial IoT. His background is in electrical engineering, embedded devices and test automation. Combining his background with the hobby in hacking lead to a natural career shift to cybersecurity. In his free time, Bug Bounties and CTFs keep Aapo motivated and learning, but he is more interested in developing the tools and making the challenges than actually solving them. Aapo has gained professional and Bug Bounty success with his work in PKI and TLS, resulting in multiple CVEs in notable products from Microsoft and Apple.
